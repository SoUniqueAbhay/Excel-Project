This project analyzes different datasets related to demographics, purchases, and occupation in a hypothetical population. The following datasets are included:

*  Average of Income
*  Count of Purchased Bike
*  Count of Cars
*  Count of Occupation etc.

For This project, I have taken data from Description section of Alex: The Analyst Youtube video but I have created dashboard graphs from my insights on the data given.
